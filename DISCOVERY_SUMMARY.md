# Codebase Discovery Summary
**Date**: December 2, 2025
**Reviewed By**: AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

After thorough review of the Megyk Dashboard codebase, I discovered that this is a **dual-purpose application** serving two distinct business needs, built with modern technologies and best practices.

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Dual-Purpose Application Architecture ⭐

The application serves **two separate use cases**:

#### A. Book Summaries Management System (Primary Landing Route)
- Full CRUD operations for book management
- PDF upload with drag-and-drop interface
- Integration with n8n webhook for automated PDF processing
- Search, pagination, and filtering capabilities
- Comprehensive metadata fields (ISBN, cover images, genres, etc.)

**Routes**:
- `/books` - Main book listing
- `/books/new` - Create new book
- `/books/[id]` - View book details
- `/books/[id]/edit` - Edit existing book

#### B. Sales Campaign Dashboard
- Analytics dashboard for German dentist lead generation campaign
- Three-stage pipeline visualization:
  - **Finder Felix**: Postal code coverage tracking
  - **Analysis Anna**: Data enrichment status (websites/emails found)
  - **Pitch Paul**: Export to instantly.ai tracking
- Company data management with search and pagination

**Routes**:
- `/sales-campaign` - Analytics dashboard

### 2. Technology Stack Analysis ✅

| Category | Technology | Version | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Framework** | Next.js | 15.5.3 | App Router, RSC, Turbopack enabled |
| **Runtime** | React | 19.1.0 | Latest stable |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.x | Full type coverage |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | 4.1.13 | Latest version with PostCSS |
| **Database** | Supabase | Latest | PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage |
| **Auth** | @supabase/ssr | 0.7.0 | Cookie-based SSR |
| **Charts** | Recharts | 3.2.1 | For analytics visualization |
| **Icons** | Heroicons | 2.2.0 | Outline icons |
| **Automation** | n8n | - | Webhook integration |

### 3. Authentication Implementation 🔒

**Pattern**: Server-Side Rendering with Supabase Auth

- Uses `@supabase/ssr` for cookie-based session management
- Two Supabase client configurations:
  - **Server Client** (`supabase-server.ts`): For RSC and API routes
  - **Browser Client** (`supabase.ts`): For client components
- Protected routes via `(dashboard)` route group
- Session check in layout component with redirect
- Email/password authentication

**Security Features**:
- Server-side session validation
- Cookie-based persistence
- Protected API routes
- Row-Level Security (RLS) ready

### 4. Database Schema Overview 📊

#### Book Management Tables
- `books` - Main book catalog (11 fields)
  - Includes metadata: title, author, ISBN, cover, summary, etc.
  - Status tracking (draft/published)
  - Live/draft toggle
  - Genre foreign key (table may not exist yet)

#### Sales Campaign Tables
- `german_companies` - Company/lead data (13 fields)
  - Company details, contact info, location data
  - `exported_to_instantly` boolean for tracking exports
- `german_zip_codes` - Postal code reference data (7 fields)
- `finder_felix_executions` - Scraping execution tracking (4 fields)

#### Optimized Analytics Views ⚡
- `companies_stats` - Pre-aggregated company statistics
- `finder_felix_coverage` - Postal code coverage metrics
- `get_unique_postal_codes_count()` - RPC function

**Status**: Migration file exists but may need to be run on production

### 5. Performance Optimizations 🚀

**Implemented**:
1. **SQL-Level Aggregations**: Moved calculations from JavaScript to PostgreSQL views
2. **Pagination**: "Load More" pattern for both books and companies
3. **Turbopack**: Enabled for dev and build (5x faster builds)
4. **Selective Fetching**: Only fetch needed columns
5. **Parallel Queries**: Multiple analytics queries in parallel

**Fallback Strategy for Analytics**:
```
Try SQL Views → Try RPC Function → Fall back to optimized count queries
```

This ensures analytics work even if migrations haven't been run yet.

### 6. Component Architecture 🎨

**Shared Components**:
- `Sidebar.tsx` - Desktop navigation (fixed left sidebar)
- `MobileNav.tsx` - Mobile hamburger menu
- `AnalyticsChart.tsx` - Reusable donut chart (Recharts)
- `SearchBar.tsx` - Generic search component

**Book Components**:
- `BookList.tsx` - List view with pagination
- `BookForm.tsx` - Create/edit form
- `BookDropzone.tsx` - PDF upload with drag-and-drop
- `BookDetail.tsx` - Detail view
- `BookSearch.tsx` - Book-specific search

**Sales Components**:
- `CompanyDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `CompanyTable.tsx` - Data table
- `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Three-chart analytics
- `AnalyticsChart.tsx` - Reusable chart (shared)

### 7. External Integrations 🔌

#### n8n Webhook Integration
- **URL**: `https://n8n.megyk.com/webhook/ingest_book`
- **Purpose**: Process uploaded book PDFs
- **Flow**: BookDropzone → `/api/ingest-book` → n8n → Supabase
- **Processing**: Text extraction, AI summarization, metadata extraction

**Note**: Webhook URL is currently hardcoded (could be moved to env var)

### 8. Deployment Architecture 🌐

```
Internet → Caddy (megyk.com) → DigitalOcean Droplet
                                  ├── Next.js (:3000)
                                  └── n8n (:5678)
                                       ↓
                                  Supabase Cloud
```

### 9. Code Quality Observations ✨

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Consistent TypeScript usage
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns (lib/, components/, types/)
- ✅ Error handling throughout
- ✅ Loading states for better UX
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- ✅ Modern React patterns (hooks, server components)
- ✅ Optimized data fetching

**Areas for Enhancement**:
- ⚠️ No error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
- ⚠️ No caching layer (React Query, SWR)
- ⚠️ No role-based access control yet
- ⚠️ No CSV export functionality
- ⚠️ n8n webhook URL hardcoded
- ⚠️ Book genres table referenced but may not exist

### 10. Git Status Findings

**Modified Files**:
- `src/lib/analytics.ts` - Recently updated (improved optimization)

**Untracked Files**:
- `supabase/` directory - New migration files not committed yet

**Recommendation**: Commit the analytics optimization and the migration files
